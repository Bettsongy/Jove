* Classic has Jove as described in the book Automata and Computability. Its documentation of files and directories matches the book more closely.

* Modern has a more modern presentation of the content. This is recommended for use after September 2020 (perhaps even before). Name will be Modern_use_after_Sep2020 till Sep 2020, and then to be renamed to Modern.
