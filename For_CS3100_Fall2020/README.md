* This is a directory prepared for the CS 3100, Fall 2020 students
* It contains a description of how various Jove modules will be
  covered in our lectures
* I'll now straight present the syllabus and the schedule of
  lectures. Two notes are in order:
  - All Quizzes will be assigned on Canvas or Gradescope 
    - They are given out before a PAIR of lectures (occurring in a week)
    - They must be solved and submitted before those PAIR of lectures
  - All our Assignments will be provided inside the Jove notebooks
  - All our Exams (MT-1, MT-2 and Finals) will be given either on Canvas
    or on Gradescope
* CS 3100 is running in a *FLIPPED CLASS* style!
* You MUST run each Jove notebook mentioned below *BEFORE* you come
  to a lecture. These notebooks contain a video recording PLUS practice
  material for you
* Some notebooks will last across multiple lectures, and some lectures
  will involve multiple notebooks
* Assignments are to be turned in as finished Jove notebooks
* There may be occasional hand-written files to be scanned and uploaded
